# TODO:Detect when the turtle player collides with a car and stop the game if this happens.
#  If you get stuck,
#  check the video walkthrough in Step 5.

# TODO:Detect when the turtle player has reached the top edge of the screen (i.e., reached
#  the FINISH_LINE_Y). When
#  this happens, return the turtle to the starting position and increase the speed of the
#  cars. Hint: think about
#  creating an attribute and using the MOVE_INCREMENT to increase the car speed. If you get
#  stuck, check the video
#  walkthrough in Step 6.

# TODO:Create a scoreboard that keeps track of which level the user is on. Every time the
#  turtle player does a
#  successful crossing, the level should increase. When the turtle hits a car, GAME OVER
#  should be displayed in the
#  centre. If you get stuck, check the video walkthrough in Step 7.
