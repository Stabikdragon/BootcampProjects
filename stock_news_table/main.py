    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.


#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

#TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles.
# Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation

    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.
# for x in new_list_first_3:
#     title = x["title"]
#     description = x["description"]

#Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
